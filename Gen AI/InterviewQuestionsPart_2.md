# Generative AI Interview Questions

Explore a set of interview questions covering various aspects of generative AI and language models.

## Model Implementation

1. Can you walk me through the process of implementing a simple language model using a deep learning framework of your choice?
2. Demonstrate how you would load a pre-trained language model and generate text using it.

## Fine-tuning

3. Suppose you have a pre-trained language model, and you need to fine-tune it for a specific task. What steps would you take, and what considerations are important in this process?

## Prompt Engineering

4. Given a specific NLP task, how would you approach prompt engineering to improve the performance of a language model? Provide an example.

## Hosting Models in Production

5. Imagine you need to deploy a language model for a real-time application. What factors would you consider when hosting the model in a production environment? Discuss potential challenges and solutions.

## Knowledge Graph Integration

6. Describe a scenario where you would integrate a knowledge graph with a language model. How would you structure the data and utilize it to enhance model performance?

## Data Privacy Measures

7. Suggest and implement measures to ensure data privacy when working with user-generated text in a language model. Consider both training and inference stages.

## Handling Large Datasets

8. You have a large dataset for training a language model, but it exceeds the available memory. How would you efficiently handle and preprocess such large datasets?

## Model Evaluation

9. What metrics would you use to evaluate the performance of a language model on a specific NLP task? How would you interpret the results and identify areas for improvement?

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

10. Implement a simple retrieval-augmented generation system using a language model and a knowledge base. Provide a high-level overview of the architecture and demonstrate its use.

## Scalability and Efficiency

11. How would you design a system to handle the scalability and efficiency of a language model in a production environment? Consider both training and deployment aspects.

Feel free to use these questions to assess candidates' knowledge and skills in the field of generative AI during interviews.
